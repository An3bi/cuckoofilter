Outline for Blog Post on Cuckoo Filter 

-Intro paragraph on probabilistic data structures
-Reference past report by fast forward labs with respect to streaming algos
- Now we'd like to focus on a recent algorithm that didn't go into that report. (2 paragraphs)


-Cuckoo filter()
	-explain the bloom filter first
		2 paragraphs
	-now say what changes with the cuckoo filter
		1-2 paragraphs
		use paper

-python implementation

-here with do a quick comparison of the cuckoo filter with bloom etc. 
	-timing comparison
	-false positive comparison

-situation where you can use a cuckoo filter vs a bloom filter

-conclusion of the paper is where you highlight the business need. 

The case that I look at are the ones that support the advantages of the cuckoo filter use. 

--check for pep8 specifications for the codebase. 
--install the package to double check that.
